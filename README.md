# X-WIND
X-WIND is total solution software to analyze the offshore wind turbine system that performs the turbine analysis, structural analysis and diffraction/radiation analysis, has been developed in XFINASIT Co., Seoul, Korea for the analysis and design of the offshore structures including and wind turbine farms and oil/gas platforms. The current X-WIND AutoCAD program is the result of extensive research and development of the finite element program X-FINAS, which was originally develop at Imperial College, London.

The Solution of X-WIND AutoCAD program is specialized in offshore projects, including non-linear structural analysis, dynamic response analysis due to wind, current, waves, and seismic loads, impact dynamics and collapse analysis and pile-soil-interaction. X-WIND can carry out the fatigue analysis for tubular steel structures in frequency and time domain. It can also post-process the fatigue analysis output from GH-Bladed and OpenFAST. X-WIND includes the features of the Morison equation or diffraction wave theory using 3D solid and shell elements to be applied in the Gravity Base Foundation of concrete and steel offshore structures. The motion and loading analyses carried out from aerodynamic module are validated with three types of platform structure produced by OpenFAST (NREL, USA).

The X-WIND is AutoCAD embeded software which the Pre/Postprocessor of X-WIND is integrated with the "ADD IN" function of AutoCAD. Through interactive approach of AutoCAD, the finite element calculation make users obtain calculation results and report with visualization of post-processing in AutoCAD environment.
